This project demonstrates how to integrate Extent Reports with TestNG to generate informative and organized test reports. Extent Reports provides rich visualization and customization options to present your test results in a clear and appealing format.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**

   - Java JDK
   - TestNG
   - Extent Reports
   - Any IDE or build tool of your choice (Eclipse, IntelliJ, Maven, Gradle, etc.)

2. **Setup:**

   - Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP archive.

3. **Usage:**

   - Open the project in your chosen IDE or build tool.
   - Configure the necessary dependencies (TestNG and Extent Reports) in your project's build 
     configuration.
   - Modify the test classes (`ExceptionTest` and `StringOperation`) to define your test cases and 
     exceptions.
   - Implement the `ITestListener` class to customize how you want to log test results and exceptions.
   - Run your tests using TestNG and observe the generated Extent Report which is at project directory
   - Grouping the failed test cases according to their exception has been done
